# Vulnerable PHP WebApp

This is a Web-based Application that is intended to be Vulnerable.

## Introduction
As i dig deeper into cybersecurity particularly penetration testing, i need to know more about the underlying technologies built inside it. This is my attempt to study and practice on how bad and vulnerable codes works and how the secure code is implemented.

## To do list
 - [ ] Get the web app running

## Problems:
 - [ ] The routing mechanism is still flawed where user is redirected to the homepage even after accessing the '/login' page.
